  "One of my recent projects involved developing an admin panel for the blog of a podcaster and public speaker. The platform is designed to manage podcast episodes, upcoming events, and blog articlesâ€”all from a single, intuitive admin interface.",
  "The project uses DigitalOcean's S3-compatible object storage to host podcast episode files in MP3 format. The admin can manage each episode's title, description, and slug (which defines the podcast's URL on the blog), providing full control over SEO.",
  "For content publishing, the admin can share articles on the blog using a rich text editor (Tiptap), offering a smooth and flexible writing experience. You can check the screenshots for a closer look at the interface.",
  "The system also includes functionality to manage upcoming events that the public speaker will attend, keeping followers informed and engaged.",
  "The blog is fully SEO-optimizedâ€”from sitemaps and robots.txt files to metadata (titles and descriptions) for each page. I also used a wide range of server components to ensure optimal performance and search engine visibility."
